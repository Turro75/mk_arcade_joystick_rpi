# mk_arcade_joystick_rpi #

The Raspberry Pi GPIO Joystick Driver

The mk_arcade_joystick_rpi is fully integrated in the **recalbox** distribution : see http://www.recalbox.com

**The branch [hotkeybtn](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/mk_arcade_joystick_rpi/tree/hotkeybtn) now support one more button per player in place of MCP23017 support. And also gpio customization for both players**

## Introduction ##

The RaspberryPi is an amazing tool I discovered a month ago. The RetroPie project made me want to build my own Arcade Cabinet with simple arcade buttons and joysticks.

So i started to wire my joysticks and buttons to my raspberry pi, and I wrote the first half of this driver in order to wire my joysticks and buttons directly to the RPi GPIOs.

However, the Raspberry Pi Board B Rev 2 has a maximum of 21 usable GPIOs, not enough to wire all the 28 switches (2 joystick and 20 buttons) that a standard panel requires.

UPDATE 0.1.6 : removed I2C support, compatibily rpi4, kernel > 4.15 support

UPDATE 0.1.5 : Added GPIO customization

UPDATE 0.1.4 : Compatibily with rpi2 

UPDATE 0.1.3 : Compatibily with 3.18.3 :

The driver installation now works with 3.18.3 kernel, distributed with the last firmware.

UPDATE 0.1.2 : Downgrade to 3.12.28+ :

As the module will not load with recent kernel and headers, we add the possibility of downgrading your firmware to a compatible version, until we find a fix.

UPDATE 0.1.1 : RPi B+ VERSION :

The new Raspberry Pi B+ Revision brought us 9 more GPIOs, so we are now able to connect 2 joysticks and 12 buttons directly to GPIOs. I updated the driver in order to support the 2 joysticks on GPIO configuration.

## The Software ##
The joystick driver is based on the gamecon_gpio_rpi driver by [marqs](https://github.com/marqs85)

It is written for 4 directions joysticks and 9 buttons per player.

It can read one joystick + 9 buttons wired on RPi GPIOs (two on RPi B+ revision)  

It uses internal pull-ups of RPi, so all switches must be directly connected to its corresponding GPIO and to the ground.


## Common Case : Joysticks connected to GPIOs ##


### Pinout ###
Let's consider a 7 buttons cab panel with this button order : 

     ↑   Ⓨ Ⓧ Ⓛ  
    ← →	 Ⓑ Ⓐ Ⓡ Ⓗ
     ↓  

With Ⓡ = Right trigger = TR and Ⓛ  = Left trigger = TL  
Ⓗ is the Hotkey.

Here is the rev B GPIO pinout summary :

If you have a Rev B+ RPi or RPi2:

Of course the ground can be common for all switches.

### Installation ###

### Installation Script ###

Download the installation script : 
```shell
mkdir mkjoystick
cd mkjoystick
wget https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/mk_arcade_joystick_rpi/releases/download/v0.1.4/install.sh
```

Update your system :
```shell
sudo sh ./install.sh updatesystem
sudo reboot
```

Don't forget to reboot (or the next part won't work) and re-run the script without any arguments :
```shell
sudo sh ./install.sh
```

Now jump to [Loading the driver](#loading-the-driver)


### Manual Installation ###
Update system :
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo rpi-update
```


1 - Install all you need :
```shell
sudo apt-get install -y --force-yes dkms cpp-4.7 gcc-4.7 git joystick
```

2 - Install last kernel headers :
```shell
sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
```

3.a - Install driver from release (prefered):  
```shell
wget https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/mk_arcade_joystick_rpi/releases/download/v0.1.4/mk-arcade-joystick-rpi-0.1.4.deb
sudo dpkg -i mk-arcade-joystick-rpi-0.1.4.deb
```
3.b - Or compile and install with dkms:  

3.b.1 - Download the files:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/pinuct/mk_arcade_joystick_rpi
```
3.b.2 - Create a folder under  "/usr/src/*module*-*module-version*/"
```shell
mkdir /usr/src/mk_arcade_joystick_rpi-0.1.5/
```
3.b.3 - Copy the files into the folder:
```shell
cd mk_arcade_joystick_rpi/
cp -a * /usr/src/mk_arcade_joystick_rpi-0.1.5/
```
3.b.4 - Compile and install the module:
```shell
dkms build -m mk_arcade_joystick_rpi -v 0.1.5
dkms install -m mk_arcade_joystick_rpi -v 0.1.5
```

### Loading the driver ###

The driver is loaded with the modprobe command and take one parameter nammed "map" representing connected joysticks. 
When you will have to load the driver you must pass a list of parameters that represent the list of connected Joysticks. The first parameter will be the joystick mapped to /dev/input/js0, the second to js1 etc..

If you have connected a joystick on RPi GPIOs (joystick 1 on the pinout image) you must pass "map=1" as a parameter. If you are on B+ revision and you connected 2 joysticks you must pass map="1,2" as a parameter.

If you have one joystick connected on your RPi B or B+ version you will have to run the following command :

```shell
sudo modprobe mk_arcade_joystick_rpi map=1
```

If you have two joysticks connected on your RPi B+ version you will have to run the following command :

```shell
sudo modprobe mk_arcade_joystick_rpi map=1,2

```

If you don't want to use all pins or wants a **custom gpio** map use:
```shell
sudo modprobe mk_arcade_joystick_rpi map=4 gpio=pin1,pin2,pin3,.....,pin12
```
Where *pinx* is the number of the gpio you want. There are 12 posible gpio with **button order: Y-,Y+,X-,X+,start,select,a,b,tr,y,x,tl,hk.** Use -1 for unused pins. For example `gpio=21,13,26,19,-1,-1,22,24,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1` uses gpios 21,13,26,19 for axis and gpios 22 and 24 for A and B buttons, the rest of buttons are unused.

If you want customization for both players use `map=4,5` and `gpio=` for player 1 and `gpio2=` for player 2. Example:

```
# same configuration as map=1,2 but manually:
sudo modprobe mk_arcade_joystick_rpi map=4,5 gpio=4,17,27,22,10,9,25,24,23,18,15,14,2 gpio2=11,5,6,13,19,26,21,20,16,12,7,8,3

# If you use a TFT and want two players, you can´t use all gpios.
# Example with two players and only axes, A and B buttons
sudo modprobe mk_arcade_joystick_rpi map=4,5 gpio=4,17,27,22,-1,-1,25,24,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1 gpio2=11,5,6,13,19,-1,-1,20,16,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
```

The GPIO joystick 1 events will be reported to the file "/dev/input/js0" and the GPIO joystick 2  events will be reported to "/dev/input/js1"

### Auto load at startup ###

Open `/etc/modules` :

```shell
sudo nano /etc/modules
```

and add the line you use to load the driver : 

```shell
mk_arcade_joystick_rpi
```

Then create the file `/etc/modprobe.d/mk_arcade_joystick.conf` :
```shell
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/mk_arcade_joystick.conf
```

and add the module configuration : 
```shell
options mk_arcade_joystick_rpi map=1,2
```

### Testing ###

Use the following command to test joysticks inputs :
```shell
jstest /dev/input/js0
```
